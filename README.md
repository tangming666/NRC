# NRC

The code was written in Matlab 

It should be noted that the data MGCD I use is not public. If you want, you can email Liu Shuang. This is her email

shuangliu.tjnu@gmail.com

When you have a MGCD dataset, you just need to import all the data in date folder and run classification. 

It is worth mentioning that if you use the data in date folder, the dataset should be the same as mine to ensure that you can get satisfactory results.

If you get Liu Shuang's right to use MGCD, you can send me an email to get the dataset I use

Here is my email 1543832341@qq.com

If you want to use your own data set, you can refer to my paper
